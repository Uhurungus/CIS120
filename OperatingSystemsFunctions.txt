An operating system is the go-between bridge from user to hardware and back again.  It allows us to use the hardware to execute functions or programs.  A GUI or graphical user interface uses computer generated graphics to do this.  The user interacts with representations of pictures or symbols that represent different pre-programmed functions to get the computer to do what they want it to do.
An NUI or natural user interface aims to do the same work of communication between the user and the hardware but in a slightly different way.  Or maybe better said, in the same manner using different tools.  Well, actually the NUI can seem like a GUI in that usually a touchscreen is used.  Its purpose is to encourage as natural an interaction as possible for the user to communicate.  Examples of this are touching, swiping, fingerscrolling, etc.
