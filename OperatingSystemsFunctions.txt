An operating system is the go-between bridge from user to hardware and back again.  It allows us to use the hardware to execute functions or programs.  A GUI or graphical user interface uses computer generated graphics to do this.  The user interacts with representations of pictures or symbols that represent different pre-programmed functions to get the computer to do what they want it to do.
